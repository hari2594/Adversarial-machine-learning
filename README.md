## Adversarial machine learning

`Machine learning` techniques were originally designed for stationary and benign environments in which the training and test data are assumed to be generated from the same statistical distribution. However, when those models are implemented in the real world, the presence of intelligent and adaptive adversaries may violate that statistical assumption to some degree, depending on the adversary. This technique shows how a malicious adversary can surreptitiously manipulate the input data so as to exploit specific vulnerabilities of learning algorithms and compromise the security of the machine learning system.
